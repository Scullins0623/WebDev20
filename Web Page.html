          <h2>Fantasy</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
          Fantasy is a world outside of our own where the things one imagines are reality. I personally enjoy reading fantasy. It allows me to leave my mind for a while.

        <h3>Sports</h3>
    </header>
    <p>
      I have been playing sports since I was around six. The sports have ranged from indoor/outdoor soccer and track and field. I enjoy the movement and exercise along with the competition.

      <h3>Games</h3>
  </header>
      <p>
        This ranges from video games to board and card games. Similarly with fantasy I play games to see a place I haven't been.
